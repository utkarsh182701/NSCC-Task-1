NSCC SRM IST - Recruitment Tasks
This repository contains the completed technical tasks for the Newton School Coding Club recruitment process. Both projects are built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, demonstrating a strong understanding of front-end development fundamentals.

Task 1: Signup Form & Dashboard
A fully functional, single-page application for user signup, input validation, and data management. The application securely handles user data and displays it in a clean, interactive dashboard.

üöÄ Deployed Link

Live Site: https://nscctask.netlify.app

‚ú® Key Features

Client-Side Validation: Ensures that username, email, and password fields meet specific criteria before submission.

Secure Password Hashing: Uses the browser's built-in Web Crypto API (SHA-256) to hash passwords before storing them, ensuring user data is never stored as plain text.

Persistent Data Storage: Leverages localStorage to save user data, so it persists even after the browser is closed.

Dynamic Dashboard: All registered users are displayed in a clean, real-time table.

Delete Functionality: Includes a "delete" button for each user to remove their entry from storage, demonstrating DOM manipulation and data management.
